# Newsty-Project
Vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript web application using [newsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to search actual news by keywords.

## Concepts learnt during the project
During the Newsty Project I used many important javascript concepts such as:
- DOM Elements operations, events
- Data Structures, OOP, Modern operators
- Function callbacks
- AJAX
- API calls
- Module import/export
- NPM, parcel
- Local storage
- MVC Architecture

## App utilities
The user can:
- Search for the latest news using keywords
- See the listed articles previews containing thumbnails and short descriptions
- Show the article by clicking on the preview
- Save the article to the bookmark list and display them later by hovering the 'interesting' button
- Create own articles and display them

## Check it out on your own! 
### ❗ Disclaimer ❗

Unfortunately, the newsAPI does not allow the users to create API calls from the browser, except of the localhost. This means that you cannot search for the articles using the site hosted online. However, you can still add new articles and add them to bookmarks!
